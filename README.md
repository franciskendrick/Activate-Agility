# **Activate: Agility**
Activate: Agility is a single-player game inspired by an adventure sports center I saw on Tiktok, [Activate Games](https://www.tiktok.com/@activatecanada). This is the particular [Tiktok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@activatecanada/video/7036971697014148357?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1) that I saw on the site and thought to create a Python game out of it.

This project was created using Python 3.x, and a Python library, [Pygame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame).

**PS:** In the options window, the **_FULLSCREEN_** button doesn't work because I'm too lazy to remove it. <br>
**PPS:** Since the game is always on fullscreen, use **Alt+F4** to quit the game.

## **Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- pygame

## **How to Use:**
- Run _scr/main.py_.
